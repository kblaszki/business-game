# Documentation map

This directory documents **sfml-game-lab** following the [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework. Every document starts with a YAML front-matter block; agents should search by the `related_code` and `keywords` fields to find the right page.

## How the docs are organized

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Index[index.md] --> Tut[tutorials/ learning]
  Index --> How[how-to/ tasks]
  Index --> Ref[reference/ facts]
  Index --> Exp[explanation/ rationale]
  Ref -->|related_code| Code[engine/ and games/]

```

| Quadrant | When to read | Purpose |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| Tutorials | First time with the repo | Learn by doing, end to end |
| How-to | You have a specific task | Steps to reach a goal |
| Reference | You need a precise fact | Describe what exists, mirrors code |
| Explanation | You want the "why" | Design rationale and direction |

## All documents

| Document | Type | Keywords |
|----------|------|----------|
| [tutorials/getting-started.md](tutorials/getting-started.md) | tutorial | setup, toolchain, build, run, msys2 |

| [reference/arkanoid-sim.md](reference/arkanoid-sim.md) | reference | arkanoid sim, StageId, power-ups |
| [reference/tetris-sim.md](reference/tetris-sim.md) | reference | tetris sim, Grid, SRS, kicks |
| [reference/arkanoid-app.md](reference/arkanoid-app.md) | reference | Theme, Assets, HudModel, Sounds, Feedback, ResultScene, high score |
| [reference/tetris-app.md](reference/tetris-app.md) | reference | Theme, Bindings, BoardRender, Sounds, Feedback, high score |

| [explanation/architecture.md](explanation/architecture.md) | explanation | ADR, eng, arkanoid, boundaries, ECS |
| [../mvp/README.md](../mvp/README.md) | design notes (not Diátaxis) | prospective engine plan |
| [../mvp/10-engine-progress.md](../mvp/10-engine-progress.md) | living tracker (not Diátaxis) | slices, eng modules, arkanoid |

`mvp/01`–`09` are prospective. Living engine progress is [`mvp/10-engine-progress.md`](../mvp/10-engine-progress.md). Current facts live in the Diátaxis pages above; prefer `engine/` and `games/arkanoid/` over chapter prose if they disagree.

## Maintenance

Documentation currency is enforced by the always-on rule `.cursor/rules/documentation.mdc` and the `update-docs` skill. When code changes, update the docs whose `related_code` lists the touched files, refresh their `last_reviewed`, and keep this table in sync.
