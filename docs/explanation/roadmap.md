# Project direction and status

## Where it is now

A C++23 SFML 3.1 skeleton with window, clock, `ScreenStack`, `MainMenuScreen`, and empty `GameplayScreen` (Enter to start). CMake presets, FetchContent for SFML (no Audio/Network) and GoogleTest 1.18, windowless tests.

Facts: [source-layout.md](../reference/source-layout.md). Prospective engine notes: [`mvp/01`–`09`](../../mvp/README.md). What already landed: [`mvp/10-engine-progress.md`](../../mvp/10-engine-progress.md).

There is no pause overlay, `Action` mapper, World, or Arkanoid session in this tree.

## Where it is going

Use `mvp/01`–`09` as prospective design notes, not as a description of the current code. Track landed slices in [`mvp/10-engine-progress.md`](../../mvp/10-engine-progress.md).
