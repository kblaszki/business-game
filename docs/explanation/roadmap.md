# Project direction and status

## Where it is now

A C++23 SFML 3.1 breakout on the landed engine split (`engine/` / `games/arkanoid/`): Start/Quit menu, three stages (Stage1 → Stage2 → Stage3), four power-ups (Wide, MultiBall, Slow, ExtraLife), pause overlay via `SceneStack`, headless tests. Legacy `src/` is removed. The engine namespace is `sgl`.

Facts: [source-layout.md](../reference/source-layout.md), [arkanoid-sim.md](../reference/arkanoid-sim.md). Contract: [architecture.md](architecture.md). Prospective notes: [`mvp/01`–`09`](../../mvp/README.md). Landed slices: [`mvp/10-engine-progress.md`](../../mvp/10-engine-progress.md).

## Where it is going

Phase II locks namespace `sgl`, fixes input edges and Arkanoid physics, turns power-ups into data, and adds `sgl_audio`, `sgl_fx`, `sgl_save`, and a headless Tetris under `games/tetris/`. Use `mvp/01`–`09` as prospective design notes, not as a description of the current code. Track landed slices in [`mvp/10-engine-progress.md`](../../mvp/10-engine-progress.md).
