# Project direction and status

## Where it is now

A C++23 SFML 3.1 skeleton with a window port: CMake presets, FetchContent for SFML (no Audio/Network) and GoogleTest 1.18, `Game` driving `WindowI` (SFML adapter on the `game` executable), and windowless tests (`example_test`, `game_test`).

Facts: [source-layout.md](../reference/source-layout.md). Prospective engine notes: [`mvp/01`–`09`](../../mvp/README.md). What already landed: [`mvp/10-engine-progress.md`](../../mvp/10-engine-progress.md).

There is no menu, Arkanoid session, pause overlay, or screen stack in this tree.

## Where it is going

Use `mvp/01`–`09` as prospective design notes, not as a description of the current code. Track landed slices in [`mvp/10-engine-progress.md`](../../mvp/10-engine-progress.md).
