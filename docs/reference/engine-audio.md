# Engine audio

Headless PCM and playback port in `namespace sgl`, included as `<sgl/audio/X.hpp>`. Target `sgl_audio` is a STATIC library that PUBLIC-links `sgl_core`. No SFML dependency.

SFML playback lives in `sgl::sfml::SfmlAudio` (`sgl_sfml`, links `SFML::Audio` PRIVATE).

## SoundId and Pcm

- `SoundId` — `Handle<SoundTag>` (same style as `TextureId`)
- `Pcm` — mono buffer: `uint32_t sampleRate` + `std::vector<int16_t> samples`

## Waveform, Envelope, tone

`enum class Waveform { Square, Triangle, Noise }`.

`Envelope` holds `Seconds attack` and `Seconds release`. Linear fades: attack from silence to full, release from full to silence; sustain between them is full gain.

`tone(waveform, freqHz, duration, sampleRate, envelope, amplitude)` builds mono PCM. Sample count is `duration * sampleRate`. Peak magnitude never exceeds `amplitude` (scaled to int16). Noise samples use `sgl::Pcg32` from `<sgl/core/Random.hpp>`.

## AudioI and NullAudio

```cpp
class AudioI {
public:
    virtual ~AudioI();
    virtual void play(SoundId, float volume) = 0;
};
```

`NullAudio` implements `play` as a no-op (any id / volume accepted). Tests use `AudioSpy` (`tests/mocks/AudioSpy.hpp`) to record `{SoundId, volume}` plays.

## SfmlAudio

`SfmlAudio : AudioI` caches `sf::SoundBuffer` via `ResourceCache<SoundId, sf::SoundBuffer>`.

| API | Behavior |
|-----|----------|
| `upload(key, pcm)` | Load/cache buffer; empty or zero-rate PCM → `DecodeFailed` |
| `play(id, volume)` | Volume in `[0,1]` mapped to SFML 0–100. Picks a stopped voice among 16 `std::optional<sf::Sound>` slots; if all busy, replaces the oldest started |

`SfmlPlatform` owns `SfmlAudio` via `std::unique_ptr` (member order: window, assets, audio, renderer) so the platform header exposes only `AudioI& audio()` without pulling SFML Audio into game TUs. Links `SFML::Audio` PRIVATE.
