# Engine save

Static library target `sgl_save` (`namespace sgl`), linked `PUBLIC` to `sgl_core` only. No SFML. Include as `<sgl/save/X.hpp>`.

Persists high-score tables as versioned text files under a platform user-data directory.

## SaveError

`enum class SaveError { NotFound, Io, Corrupt }`.

`describe(error)` returns a stable C string label (`"NotFound"`, `"Io"`, `"Corrupt"`).

## HighScoreTable

Fixed-capacity descending score list. Constructor takes `capacity`. Ties keep the older (earlier-inserted) score above a new equal score.

| API | Behavior |
|-----|----------|
| `qualifies(score)` | `true` when the table is not full, or when `score` beats the current lowest entry |
| `insert(score)` | Inserts in descending order; returns 0-based rank, or `nullopt` if dropped |
| `entries()` | `std::span<const uint32_t>` over current scores (highest first) |

## Text format (`parse` / `serialize`)

First line must be exactly `sgl-highscores 1`, then one unsigned integer per line. Wrong header, non-numeric tokens, or negatives yield `SaveError::Corrupt`. `parse(text, capacity)` builds a `HighScoreTable`; `serialize` writes the header and current entries.

## Files

| API | Behavior |
|-----|----------|
| `readTextFile(path)` | Whole-file read; missing path → `NotFound`; other failures → `Io` |
| `writeTextFileAtomic(path, contents)` | Write `path` + `.tmp`, then `std::filesystem::rename` (error_code overloads) |
| `userDataDir(app)` | Windows: `APPDATA/<app>`; else `XDG_DATA_HOME/<app>` or `HOME/.local/share/<app>`; missing env → `Io` |
